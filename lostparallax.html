    <h1>Hugo "Hurley" Reyes</h1>
    <p>Hugo Reyes, more commonly known by his nickname "Hurley", was one of the middle section survivors (seat 20G) of the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Hurley's father disappeared when he was ten and did not return until Hurley was 27. During his father's absence, Hurley developed an eating disorder, and later a traumatic accident landed him in a mental asylum where he started seeing an imaginary person. He was overly conscious about his sanity and weight afterwards. While employed at Mr. Cluck's, Hurley won the lottery by playing the numbers given to him by Lenny. Because of a series of unfortunate incidents following his win, he believed himself to be plagued with bad luck because of the numbers and searched for an answer to the curse.</p>
